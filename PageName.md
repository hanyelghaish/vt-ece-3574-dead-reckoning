  1. ummary User stories

# User\_Story #

Like a boss.

# Build Cycle 1/31 - 2/9 #

  1. The user will see a  GUI available with buttons, "CHOOSE MAP" and "LIVE/RAW DATA" (Kim)
  1. The user will have access to accelerometer data after hitting the 2nd button (Nathan)
  1. The user will have access to filtered accelerometer data on the same page (Mike)
  1. The user will see an overlay of collision boundaries on top of the map (Roger)

# Build Cycle 2/14 - 2/23 #


  1. The user will have a non-image in the 'Map' screen built with OpenGL drawing on a Map class. (Roger && Kim)
  1. The user will have a rough estimation of speed, if not actual speed (possibly a 1-10 scale), displayed on the map screen to indicate the cross functionality of the accelerometer and the skeleton Map interface. (Nathan, Mike)

Note: The crux of our project relies on the algorithms that are applied to the hardware and data structures. This cycle will involve understanding the math and beginning to build a map with OpenGL.

# Build Cycle 2/28 - 3/15 #
The ides of March hath come.

  1. The user will have access to a map of the classroom (Kim)
  1. The user's movement will be represented with a moving dot (Nathan, Roger)
  1. The user will be able to orient the phone in any way and not have it be considered movement. (Mike)

# Build Cycle 3/20 - 3/29 #
  1. User will be able to enter pedometer mode, with no map. (Mike)
  1. User will be able to enter tracking mode to see their approximate location relative to their starting position, with no map. (Mike)
  1. Integrate the map with the moving dot and also draw a trace of where the dot moves. (Kim & Roger)
  1. Enhanced splash screen with flash animation (Kim & Roger)

# Build Cycle 4/3 - 4/12 #
  1. Both ends of application will be fully integrated into a single apk (Roger)
  1. Replace moving arrow with better graphic (Kim)
  1. New User interface with more consistent design (Kim)
  1. Put the moving dot on top of the map (Kim)
  1. Scale the movement of the dot to return actual distance travel in feet (Mike)

# Build Cycle 4/17 - 4/26 #
  1. Application will have at least one new method of calculating distance, hopefully improving accuracy (Mike)
  1. User will be able to select which measurement method to use (Mike)
  1. User will be able to enter a calibration mode (Mike)
  1. Block the moving dot from moving across the wall or on top of other objects (Kim and Roger)
  1. Integrate other maps with the moving dot (Kim and Roger)
