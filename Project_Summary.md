<h2>Project Overview</h2>

GPS-based navigation works well when the user has a clear view of the sky; however, the signals transmitted by the GPS constellation are relatively weak and easy to occlude.  When a user is indoors, or in a dense metropolitan area, obtaining location via GPS becomes difficult or impossible.  In these situations, an alternative means of navigation is desirable.  Our Android app will be an indoor navigation tool that uses dead reckoning to determine the user's location when GPS is unavailable.<br>
<br>
Dead reckoning is a technique that uses one's last known location and subsequent movements to compute one's new location. By collecting accelerometer, gyroscope and compass data, our application will determine the user's location without needing constant updates from external signals like GPS.<br>
<br>
<h2>Novelty and Complexity</h2>

Navigation by dead reckoning, particularly as it applies to pedestrian use, is an area of active research.  We expect that noisy sensors and erratic human motion will make location tracking very difficult.  We will start with a basic implementation and attempt to improve performance as the semester progresses.<br>
